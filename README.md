This SDK has been provided as a means for users to quickly and easily access public endpoints and return data.

## Obtaining an API Key
You do not require an API Key from Running Tracks for public endpoints. If you are accessing a public endpoint, your api key and api secret will not be referenced or checked and will not count towards your limits.
